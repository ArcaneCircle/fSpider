## Spider Solitaire

Just a simple Spider Solitaire clone, written in javascript. 
The project utilizes [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/) for the canvas/drawing and [howler](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) for the sound effects.

## Building

```
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

A `.xdc` file will be generated in the `dist` folder, then just send it in any chat
and you should be able to play the game.
