Just a simple Spider Solitaire clone, written in javascript. 
The project utilizes [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/) for the canvas/drawing and [howler](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) for the sound effects.

**Feel free to embed this game on your own website. I only ask that you credit me somehow (a link to this github page would be good).**

The [latest version of the game](http://fuzzley.info/spider/) is hosted on http://fuzzley.info/spider/. You may have to clear your cache to see changes. If you find any problems, or if you'd like to see a feature implemented, please let me know :).

Have fun!
